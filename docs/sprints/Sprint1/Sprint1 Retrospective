Sprint 1 Retrospective

Keep doing: Effective peer reviews
Peer reviews worked well during this sprint and helped us catch mistakes early before things were finalized. They also helped everyone understand each other’s work better, which made collaboration easier and reduced last-minute fixes.

Start doing: Improve communication
We need to communicate more clearly and more often, especially when someone is stuck or unsure about a task. Being more open about progress and issues will help the team stay aligned and avoid misunderstandings.

Stop doing: Having unclear next steps and roles
Sometimes it wasn’t clear who was responsible for what, which caused delays and confusion. We should stop ending meetings without clear next steps by making sure tasks and responsibilities are clearly assigned.

Do more of: Offering help when reviews or feedback are needed
Team members should offer help more often when someone needs something reviewed or feedback on their work. This will help keep tasks moving and prevent work from getting stuck.

Do less of: Ignoring teammates’ messages
Not responding to messages quickly slowed things down during the sprint. We should try to reply in a reasonable time, especially when the message is related to a task or blocker.
