Sprint 2 Retrospective

Keep doing: Clearer task breakdown
Tasks were easier to understand this sprint, which helped everyone work more efficiently.

Start doing: Testing earlier
We should start testing sooner to catch issues before the end of the sprint.

Stop doing: Last-minute integration
Waiting until the end to merge work caused unnecessary stress and small bugs.

Do more of: Mid-sprint check-ins
Quick check-ins can help catch blockers early.

Do less of: Overcommitting
We should plan more realistically to avoid rushing at the end.
