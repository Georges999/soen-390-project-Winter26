## Getting Started

When creating architecture documentation:
1. Use clear diagrams (draw.io, Lucidchart, or similar)
2. Export diagrams as both PNG and source files
3. Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
4. Include rationale for major design decisions

## Recommended Tools
- [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) - Free diagramming tool
- [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) - Database schema design
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) - Markdown-based diagrams
